# CSS343-Polynomial
This programming assignment exercises dynamic memory allocation,
pointer operations, and copy constructor design through designing a 
doubly-linked circular list with a dummy header. Using such a list,
you will implement an ADT polynomial.

The ADT polynomial can be implemented using a doubly-linked circular 
list that stores only the terms with nonzero coefficients.
